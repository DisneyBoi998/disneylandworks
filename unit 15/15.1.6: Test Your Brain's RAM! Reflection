1. How is this memory game similar to a computer's RAM?
    The pictures that are hidden under each card are readily available. It is also temporary storage since the pictures change from game to game.
    
2. Why would the skills needed for this game **not** be considered "hard drive" skills?
    This game is all about short term memory. Once a new game starts, your brain has forgotten which pictures were under which card from the previous game. 

3. Name a few things that are in your brain's "hard drive".
    Phone numbers, song lyrics, addresses, etc.
