1. Jamal plugged his new touchpad device into the USB port. He keeps getting a message that says that the device is not recognized.
    Jamal will need to locate and install the driver for his device. He can use the installation CD or find the driver online.

2. Felicia lost the driver CD for her new monitor. She can't install the monitor without the correct driver. 
    Felicia can search online for the correct driver. She'll need to find the model number of the monitor, search for the drivers for that device and select either the Windows or Mac driver depending on which OS she is using. 

3. Credence just recently changed from a Windows computer to a Mac. His Bluetooth headphones worked fine on the Windows computer but they won't connect on the new computer. 
    Credence will need to make sure that his headphones are compatible with Mac computers. He can then pair his headphones to the new computer through Bluetooth.
