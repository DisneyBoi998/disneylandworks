What would YOU want in a computer setup? Explain your ideal computer setup, 
including all of the peripherals that you would include.
My ideal computer setup would include three monitors and a Bluetooth keyboard, mouse and headphones. 

One of the monitors would be a laptop so that I could just take the laptop on the go if I wanted to. The other two monitors would be wired and I would only use them when I was in my room at my desk.

I would also want a USB trackpad or pen so that I could draw easily on the computer and really good speakers (wired) so that I could listen to music and watch movies.
