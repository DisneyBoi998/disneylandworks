(1) I prefer the while loop with break
statement because it ensures the program gets into the loop, and I don't have to 
initially think about the condition. Then, I can think through what condition
will end the loop and add in the break statement. I also like how it only asks
the user for input once instead of twice. 

(2) I prefer the standard while loop
because it is more likely to avoid an infinite loop. Although there is a line of 
repeated code, this approach is actually shorter, so I think it is more efficient. 
Lastly, including the condition as part of the while loop instead of an 
if statement makes it simpler.
