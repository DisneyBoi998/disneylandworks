1. Why is security important at Google specifically and why do you think 
   it's important at other organizations, as well? 
   because they have a big company and have to be able to keep a reputation
   
2. Does being a security engineer sound like a career / job that you 
   might be interested in?  If so, why? 
   maybe
   
3. What other questions would you like to ask these two engineers from Google?
idk
